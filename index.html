  <h2>About Waters Estates</h2>
  <p>
    I founded Waters Estates out of a passion for real estate and its ability to create lasting value.
    My goal is to work directly with homeowners and property owners to structure solutions that meet
    their needs—whether that means flexibility, certainty, or a smoother transition than a traditional sale.

  <h2>Residential Homeowners & Sellers</h2>
  <p>
    For homeowners looking to sell, Waters Estates can structure creative, non-traditional solutions
    that avoid the stress and uncertainty of a conventional listing.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchase with a 10% down payment</li>
    <li>Short-term, interest-only payments</li>
    <li>Balloon payoff at the end of the term</li>
    <li>No repairs required — properties sold as-is</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Commercial & Multifamily Owners</h2>
  <p>
    For multifamily and commercial owners, Waters Estates offers long-term, predictable exit structures
    that prioritize steady income and reduced management responsibilities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed monthly annuity-style payments</li>
    <li>Typically structured over a 10-year term</li>
    <li>Smaller final lump-sum payoff</li>
    <li>Secured by promissory note and lien</li>
  </ul>
